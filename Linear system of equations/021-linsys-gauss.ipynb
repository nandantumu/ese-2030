    "_Gaussian Elimination_ is a simple systematic algorithm to solve systems of linear equations.  You saw a version of it in Math 1410 when you covered [row reduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axSR_SMzRy8&index=81&list=PL8erL0pXF3JYm7VaTdKDaWc8Q3FuP8Sa7).  We'll remind ourselves of the basics of row reduction and Gaussian elimination, before moving on to more advanced (and practical) approaches to solving systems of linear equations.  In this section, we review the method in the most important case, in which there is the same number of equations as unknowns, and we'll come back to the general situation later on.\n",

When we ask you to solve problems by hand, $n$ is typically 2 or 3, but we will see and solve problems where $n$ is in the hundreds or even thousands!\n",

Our goal is to apply [](#linop1) judiciously to transform the system of linear equations [](#simple-linsys) into a much simpler one that is easy to solve but still has the same solutions as the original.  Any linear system that is derived from the original system by successive application of such operations will be called an _equivalent system_.  An important property is that _equivalent systems have the same solutions._\n",
    "\n",

Moreover, once we have solved this subsystem for $x_2$ and $x_3$, we can substitute the answer into the first equation, and we need only solve a single linear equation for $x_1$.\n",

    "which is the simple system we have been working towards.  It is in what is called _triangular form_: the first equation depends on all three variables, the second only depends on the second and third variables, and the last equation involves only the last variable.  The process we went through of transforming the original system [](#simple-linsys) to the triangular system [](#simple-linsys2) is an example of _Forward Elimination_: we work our way down the equations, eliminating variables as we go.  Once a system is in triangular form, it can be straightforwardly solved by the method of _Back Substitution_.  As the name suggests, we work backwards, solving the last equation first, which requires that $x_3=1$.  We substitute the result back into the middle equation, which becomes $2x_2-1=3$, with solution $x_2=2$.  We finally substitute the two values $x_2=2$ and $x_3=1$ into the first equation, which becomes $x_1+5=2$, and so the solution to the triangular system [](#simple-linsys2) is\n",

    "Even more exciting is that recalling [](#linop1), we know that the triangular system [](#simple-linsys2) is equivalent to our original system [](#simple-linsys), which means that this is also the solution to our original system of equations (you can check).  We note that in this case, system [](#simple-linsys) has a unique, meaning one and only one, solution.  We'll understand why this is the case later in the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process was incredibly simple and intuitive: add equations together to eliminate ``downstairs'' variables until you have found an equivalent triangular system, which can then be readily solved via back substitution.  Amazingly, barring a few minor complications that can come up from time to time, this is essentially all there is to _Gaussian Elimination_.  This incredibly simple algorithm is also unbelievably important and powerful.  After a brief detour to remind ourselves about matrix and vector notation, we'll revisit Gaussian Elimination through the lens of _matrix factorization_, which will allow us to easily automate and scale out these ideas to systems with hundreds or even thousands of variables.
